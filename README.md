# README

## Current standards

- most code is adapted to work with edge-lists or adjacency matrices
- if graph object is used, it is build on top of Networkx (igraph options/ conversions need to be implemented)
- main functions provide option to run async (on one core) and/or as multiprocesses or as a single thread on one core
- currently we are just writing functions - classes can be added later if desired
- see excel for details
