def weak_link_communities(H, weights=&#34;weight&#34;, t=0.2, max_iter=1000, by_degree=True, r=5, std=0.2, min_community=10, graph=False):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Tries to find weak links between node groups, while ensuring that no new isolates occure.
    For each node a probabilistic selection of neighbors is run for r rounds based on their edge weights.
    Neigbors with less than t occurenses will be disconnected but only if this link is selected as a weak link in both directions.
    The algorithm will stop when max_iter is reached or no edges can be removed anymore.
    
    Parameters:

        G (networkX graph object):
        weights (str): edge attribute to be used.
        t (float): in [0,1]. Treshold on which edges are &#34;selected as weak&#34; and to be removed if they occure &lt;= in of samples neighbors.
        max_iter (int): maximum number of iterations. 
        by_degree (boolean): if True then the number of samplings for each node is based on its degree. Each node will sample from its neighbors r*node_degree times.
            If is false then each nodes neighbors will be sampled r times.
        r (int) how often a nodes neighbors are sampled.  
        std (float): treshold of a nodes neighboring sampling distribution standardiviationf. If it is above std then edge removal will be performed.
        min_community (int or None): minimum community size allowed. If already disconnected components of size &lt; min_community exist, smaller communities can still occure. 
                If None will be ignored.
        graph (boolean): if is true then the paritioned graph object will be returned as well.

    Returns:
        communities (dict): key are node IDs and value is list of communities that node belongs to.
        graph (networkX graph object): if graph is True.

    Parameters:
        G (networkX graph object):
        valuable_edge (str): determines how the most valuable edge is selected. If &#34;max_weight&#34; then the edge with the highest weight is removed.
            If &#34;min_weight&#34; the edge with the lowest weight is removed. If &#34;betweenness&#34;  the edge with the highest/ lowest betweenness centrality is removed first.
            If is &#34;current_flow_betweenness&#34; the edge with the highest/ lowest current flow betweenness centrality is removed first. If is &#34;load&#34; the edge with the highest/lowest load centrality is removed.
        k (int or None): which level(s) of the algorithms should be returned. If None all levels are returned.
        is_level (boolean): if is True then k is assumed to be the level index and only that level is returned. If it is False the the k top levels are returned. 
        attribute (str): name of the edge attribute to be used.
        w_max (boolean): only applies if valuable_edge is not &#34;max_weight&#34; or &#34;min_weight. If True then the edge with the heigest value is remvoed. If False the edge with the lowest value is removed.     
        
    Returns:
