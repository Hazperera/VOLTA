    algorithm that tries to find weak links between node groups, while ensuring that no new isolates occure

    for each node a probabilistic selection of neighbors is run for r rounds based on their edge weights
        neigbors with less than t occurenses will be disconnected but only if this link is selected as a weak link
            in both directions
        based on this it is ensured that a small nodegroup/ single node connected to a high degree node via a weak link is NOT
            disconnected, since this is the only community it belongs to

    this algorithm is tuned to similarity graphs, especially where edge weights encode aa strong association between nodes and where it
        is preferred that weak links are kept in the same community if there is no &#34;better option&#34; to assign them

    Input

        a networkx/ igraph object G

        if return_object is True then the resulting CDlib NodeClustering object is returned, for all options refer to 
            https://cdlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/classes/node_clustering.html
            this allows to retrieve a multitude of community fitness parameters

    Output

        dict, were each node ID is key and value is list of communities

        if return_object then also the whole community object is returned

    
    &#34;&#34;&#34;

    communities = cdlib.algorithms.walktrap(G)

    m = communities.to_node_community_map()
    #j = communities.to_json()

    if return_object:
        return m,  communities

    else:
        return m</code></pre>
