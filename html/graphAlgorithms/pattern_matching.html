def get_consensus_community(networks, nodes, partitionings=None, rep_network=10, seed=123, threshold=0.75, per_node=True, rep=10):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Finds a consensus community distribution between all provided networks. For each network communities are identified based on the Louvain algorithm.
    A consensus is constructed from these based on clustering.consensus_clustering(). All networks need to contain the same nodes.
    
    Parameters:
        networks (list): list of networkX graph objects.
        nodes (list): of all nodes. Ordering will be used in the output.
        partitionings (list or None): if None partitionings are estimated based on the Louvain algorithm for each provided network.
                If list then partitionings need to be provided for each network. Lists need to be lists of sublists where each item represents the partitionings of a network
                , needs to be in the same order as networks. Each item is a list of sublists where each item is a dict, where keys are node IDs and values are community IDs.
        rep_network (int): how often the Louvain algorithm should be applied to each network during the community detection stage. If partitionings is not None then this value is ignored.
        seed (int): random seed to be used for any random processes in clustering.consensus_clustering()
        treshold (float or str): if float needs to be in [0,1]. If float and not per_node all edges with a weight lower than the treshold are removed
            in the agreement graph. If float and per_node is True then for each node the weakes treshold % of edges are removed, if they are weak for 
                both nodes making up the edge. If treshold is &#34;matrix&#34; then the teshold is estimated based on a permutation of the clusterings as implemented in netneurotools.
        per_node (boolean): if True treshold is applied on a per node pasis else it is applied gloablly.
        rep (int): how often louvain clustering is reapeated on the agreement graph.

def get_statistical_overrepresented_communities(clusters_networks, nodes, pval=0.05, partions = None):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Estimates a background distribution on how likely it is for each node pair to fall in the same community.
    Based on this it can be calculated if specific communities are overrepresented within a cluster (group of networks). 
    P values are estimated based on a hypergeometric function + a Benjamin Hochberg correction. Communities are estimated on a louvain parition.

    Parameters:
        cluster_networks (dict): key is cluster ID and value is list of networkX graph objects. All networks need to have the same nodes
        nodes (list): of node IDs. 
        p (float): [0,1]. P value cutoff applied, which estimates if a node pair is statistically enriched.
        partions (dict or None): if None the community detection based on Louvain is performed on each network provided in clusters_networks.
            If it is not None a custom partioning can be provided. Key needs to be cluster ID same as in clusters_networks. 
            Value needs to be list of dicts where key is node ID and value is Community ID of performed partitionings order as the networks provided in clusters_networks.
        
    Returns:
        communities (dict): key is cluster ID and value is the community ID. Ordered the same way as nodes. 
        Communities with a single node, indicates that that node was not statistically significant connectet to any other node.

    Compares networks pairwise, based on if their community-node-overlap is statistically significant.
    For each network community detection based on louvain is perforemd. Statistical significant overlap is determained based on a provided background distribution as computed by
        generate_community_overlap_background_distribution().
    For each network pair a mean &amp; median p-value (and adjusted p-value based on a benjamin hochberg correction) is estimated based on the p-value overlap score of each community pair between these networks.

    Parameters:
        all_networks (list): of networkX graph objects or file locations if is_file is True.
        back (dict): background community overlap distribution as computed by generate_community_overlap_background_distribution().
        is_file (boolean): if True all_networks should contain file locations to pickled graph objects. If False should contain the networkX graph objects.
        steps (int): in [1,100]. Results are summarized into sections. Needs to be the same value as used to generate the background distribution.

    Returns:
        mean p value (matrix): ordered as in all_networks.
        median p value (matrix): ordered as in all_networks.
        mean corrected p value (matrix): correction performed based on a Benjamin Hochberg correction. Ordered as in all_networks.
