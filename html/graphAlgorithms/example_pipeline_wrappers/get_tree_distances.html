def helper_tree_vector(networks, nodes, tree_type=&#34;level&#34;, edge_attribute=&#34;weight&#34;, cycle_weight = &#34;max&#34;, initial_cycle_weight=True):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Estimate for each network a vector based on its tree properties. Computes a binary tree representation, where each specified node is selected as root.
    Compares same root trees between each other. 

    Parameters:
        networks (list): of networkX graph objects
        nodes (list): list of nodes that should be compared between the networks. Nodes need to be present in all networks.
        tree_type (str): if is &#34;level&#34; then a hierarchical tree is created. Paths from the root indicate how far each nodes are from the root node. Edge weights are not considered.
                                        if is &#34;cycle&#34; then a hierarchical tree is created where each node represents a cycle in the graph. 
                                                Tree leaves are the original cycles in the graph and are merged into larger cycles through edge removal until all have been merged into a single cycle.
                                                This method can be helpful to categorize cyclic graphs. The root parameter is not considered when this option is selected and only cyclic structures in the graph are considered.
                edge_attribute (str): name of the edge weights to be considered if type = &#34;cycle&#34;.
                cycle_weight (str): sets how cycles are merged i.e. which edges are removed to merge cycles into larger ones.
                                                        if is &#34;max&#34; then the edge with the highest weight is removed first. if is &#34;min&#34; then the edge with the smalles weight is removed first.
                                                        if is &#34;betweenness_max&#34; the the edge with the highest betweenness value is removed first.
                                                        if is &#34;betweenness_min&#34; the edge with the lowest betweenness value is removed first.
                initial_cycle_weight (boolean): if True the initial cycle basis is estimated based on edge weights with https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.cycles.minimum_cycle_basis.html#networkx.algorithms.cycles.minimum_cycle_basis
                                                                                if False the initial cycles are estimated based on steps only with https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.cycles.cycle_basis.html#networkx.algorithms.cycles.cycle_basis

    Returns:
        tree properties vector (list): each sublist contains a network specific vector, ordered as provided in networks.
        trees (dict): compared tree objects. Key is network ID and value is dict where key is node ID and value is tree object.
